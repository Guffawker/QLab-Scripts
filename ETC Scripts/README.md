ETC CUE SYNC
		Queries an ETC lighting console using OSC to get a count of the number of cues in a list, then requests the cue number of each one from the console. Uses the data queried to create a network cue in QLab for each cue returned, with the correct osc string /eos/cue/X/fire to trigger the cue from QLab.
		Requires OSC over UDP setup on your ETC lighting console.
ETCTCPCON FLAGGED
		Creates a TCP connection with an ETC lighting console using it's default TCP port (3032) using the socat shell command.
		Has the ability to run the connection internally in QLab or in an external Terminal window if QLab performance is a concern!
		Will automatically attempt to reestablish the TCP connection if it is ever interupted.
ETCTCPCON (Non-Flagged)
	Provides the same functionality of the Flagged version, but does not have the option to attenmpt to reestablish the connection if the cue is flagged.
	There is no performance difference between the two, but I wanted to provide the option in case there are security concerns or anything with it attempting to reconnect automatically!

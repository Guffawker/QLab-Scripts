# QLab-Scripts
Here you'll find all of the scripts I've written for various equipment, problems, workflow solutions, etc. that I've encountered while using QLab and working on shows.
Feel free to make any changes, modify things how they fit, ask questions, or post issues if you're having trouble getting things running on your system! I'll do my best to help you get it working for you!
I'll have a QLab workspace as well that I'll keep regularly updated with the cues already built, as well as some other toys/tricks/solutions I use natively!

Currently I've tested on both Intel and M1 Macs, running Big Sur, High Sierra, and Ventura. These scripts have only been tested on QLab 4.7 as it's the only license I have currently. When I get access to 5 I'll do my best to get them updated and working on that version as well if any changes need made!

PLEASE ALWAYS TEST THESE SCRIPTS BEFORE RUNNING THEM IN A SHOW CRITICAL ENVIORNMENT!!! I have tested them pretty well with what I have, but again, every setup is different, so please ensure it works on yours before trying to apply it!

ALWAYS CHECK THE DEPENDENCIES BEING INSTALLED AS WELL! If you got any of these scripts from another source, they could be modified to install something malicious, so make sure they are installing the correct things!

If you want to see more of my work (or commission me to create a custom solution for you, or need someone to program/automate/run your show or space) visit my website at http://www.johnnybartlett.art or you can donate directly to me (right now all funds will go to upgrading my QLab license) over at http://www.buymeacoffee.com/guffawker


If you have any issues getting things to run just post an issue and I'll do my best to get things worked out for you! If you can, please leave the first comment line in the scripts unchanged so if anyone stumbles on these scripts in your workspace in the future they can find their way back here to get help if needed!
